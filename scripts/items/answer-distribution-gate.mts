// ANSWER-DISTRIBUTION GATE — can the correct answer be found without reading Dutch?
//
// This bank has already been gamed once. Before the de-game pass, 17 of 22 objective
// sections clustered on a single answer position, fourteen of them at 100%: both KNM
// modules were 30 of 30 correct-at-index-0, and every READING::CLOZE gap in the bank
// sat at index 0. A learner who always picked the first option scored 100% on the whole
// civic-knowledge surface knowing no Dutch at all.
//
// Fixing the bank fixed the bank. It does nothing about the next authoring pass, and
// the way this defect arises is not carelessness — it is what happens naturally when a
// human writes the right answer first and the distractors after it. So the rule has to
// live in the build, where it blocks, rather than in anyone's memory.
//
// ── TWO AXES, BECAUSE FIXING ONE EXPOSED THE OTHER ──────────────────────────────
//
// POSITION — "always pick index N". Ported from the AlmiSwiss gate, type-aware:
//     MULTI  (MCQ_SINGLE, CLOZE)  no option index may hold more than CLUSTER of a
//                                 section's answers (spread rule, needs MIN_N)
//     BINARY (TRUE_FALSE)         neither value past BINARY_SKEW (spread rule, MIN_N)
//     EXTREME (any type)          one value at/above EXTREME_SKEW fires at any n ≥ 3 —
//                                 a 3/3 all-same section is gameable on three answers,
//                                 and MIN_N was hiding exactly those.
//
// VALUE — "always answer Niet waar". The Swiss gate does not check this and would have
// passed this bank. Balancing POSITION here uncovered that every true/false statement in
// five sections was false: 19 TF items, not one true statement among them. While the
// keys were also all at one index the two defects were collinear and only position was
// visible; separating them left the value one standing on its own.
//
// The value rule only applies where the option TEXTS are shared across the section —
// true/false being the case that matters. For MCQ every item carries its own options,
// so "always answer X" is not a strategy and counting texts there would manufacture
// findings out of correct content. The gate checks that the option SET is identical
// across the section before it judges the value axis at all.
//
// MATCHING and ORDERING are not single-index gameable and are excluded here; their own
// degeneracy (identity pairs, pre-sorted steps, and the printed order reversed) is a
// different shape and is not what this rule measures.
//
// ── FAIL ON ZERO ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A gate that scans nothing prints a tick. That is not a hypothetical in this family:
// a sibling's ceiling-gate ticked over zero of 1,388 items because a mangled dash made
// its pattern match nothing, and the only tell was a counter that did not move. If the
// bank is empty or unreadable this exits 1 and says so — an instrument answers for its
// own coverage before it is allowed to answer about the thing it measures.
//
// SEEN RED: re-game any section (all keys to idx 0, or every TF statement false) and
// this exits 1 naming that section. Revert and it exits 0.
//
// Run: npm run gate:answer-distribution
