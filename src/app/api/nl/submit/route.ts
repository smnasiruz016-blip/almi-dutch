// PRACTICE submit endpoint. Server-authoritative: the item — and its answer key — is
// re-loaded by id inside gradeAttempt() and graded against the SERVER key. The client
// posts only { itemId, response, selfScore } and a client-supplied answer is never
// trusted. On this PRACTICE path the correct answer IS returned, for the post-submit
// per-option reveal; a mock route would run the same grader and withhold it. That split
// is decided by which route runs, never by a client flag.
//
// WHAT THIS REPLACED, AND WHY IT WAS A P0. The route used to destructure `answer`
// straight off the body and call `gradeObjective(answer, response)` — the browser sent
// the key and the server marked against it, so any POST scored 100%. `maxPoints` came
// off the body too, so the client set both the numerator and the denominator. `skill`
// and `taskType` came off the body as well, which put the Pro gate in the caller's
// hands: declaring a productive task as a free skill walked straight through it.
//
// All four now come from the server-loaded item. The client cannot state the standard,
// only the answer.
