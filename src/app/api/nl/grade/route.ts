/** EVERYTHING THE CLIENT MAY SAY. Two fields: which task, and what the learner wrote.
 *
 *  This interface used to carry exam, skill, taskType, cefr, title, prompt AND criteria,
 *  and the route graded against all of them. That made the browser the authority on the
 *  standard it was being judged by: a caller could send a B1 Inburgering letter with
 *  `cefr: "A1"` and a rewritten criteria list, and the model would faithfully return a
 *  CLEAR band against the easier standard. Nothing in the response would look wrong —
 *  the feedback would be fluent, specific and confidently addressed to the level it had
 *  been handed. That is the failure mode that matters here: not a crash, a plausible
 *  wrong verdict, which a learner has no way to detect and every reason to believe.
 *
 *  The task now comes from the server-loaded item, keyed by id. The client cannot state
 *  the standard, only the answer. */
