// Server-authoritative grading for one practice attempt.
//
// The client posts an itemId and its response. Nothing else is believed. The item — and
// its answer key — is re-loaded here by id (getItemById), so a client-supplied key is
// never trusted and the key never has to ship in the served payload at all.
//
// WHAT THIS REPLACED. /api/nl/submit used to destructure `answer` straight off the
// request body and call `gradeObjective(answer, response)`. The browser posted the key
// and the server marked against it, so any POST could score 100% — and `maxPoints` came
// from the body too, so the client set both the score and its denominator. Every
// DutchAttempt.points ever written by that path was client-asserted. (In practice none
// were: the runner never sent an itemId, so the persistence branch was dead code — the
// grading was forgeable AND nothing was recorded.)
//
// The item's correct answer is returned to the CALLER, which decides whether to
// disclose it. On the practice path it is revealed after the learner commits; a mock
// route would withhold it. That split is decided by WHICH ROUTE runs, never by a
// client flag — a flag is just another thing the browser gets to choose.
